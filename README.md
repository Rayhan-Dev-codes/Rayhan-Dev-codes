# Hi, I'm Ray 👋

I'm a beginner frontend developer learning **HTML** and **CSS**.  
This repository is my portfolio where I share the projects I build as I practice and grow my skills.

## 🌱 Current Focus
- Building responsive web pages with HTML & CSS
- Learning layouts with Flexbox and Grid
- Practicing clean, simple design

## 📂 Projects
- **Basic Portfolio Page** – My first attempt at a personal website
- **Responsive Landing Page** – Experimenting with media queries
- **CSS Styling Showcase** – Playing with colors, fonts, and layouts

*(More projects will be added as I learn!)*

## 🚀 Next Steps
As I continue learning, I plan to add:
- **JavaScript** for interactivity
- **React** for building dynamic apps
- **TailwindCSS / Bootstrap** for faster styling
- **GitHub Pages** deployment so you can view my projects live

## 📫 Connect
Feel free to check out my work and share feedback.  
This portfolio is a work in progress, and I’ll keep updating it as I grow as a developer.
